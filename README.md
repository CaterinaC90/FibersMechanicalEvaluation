# FibersMechanicalEvaluation
Procedure to evaluate force-displacement curves of single fibers. Cross-sectional area and span/gauge length needed as input for proper evaluation of the Young's modulus.

This MATLAB code allows the evaluation of single fiber force-displacement curves obtained with tensile testing.
As input, .txt files are needed containing force and displacement information from the test. Furthermore, the cross-sectional area of the different fibers and the span length is needed to obtain proper values for the stress and strain values and, finally, get information on the Young's modulus.

In the .pdf file, a complete description of the procedure is provided. Furthermore, details of the code are thouroughly described.
